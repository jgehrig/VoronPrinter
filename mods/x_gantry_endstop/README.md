# Voron V0 X Gantry Endstop
An adjustable X gantry endstop for the Voron V0.

## Motivation
The stock endstop did not reliably trigger on my printer. Occasionally, the toolhead would crash
before triggering the limit screw. The limit switch was also pressed very close to its fulcrum.

This custom endstop adds adjustment, and moves the contact point down the limit switch lever arm.

## Design
This part was designed in Fusion360:

The limit switch trigger position can be fine-tuned by rotating this part.
